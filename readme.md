# progalenor - Responive testing with protractor

Note: this is very much work in progress.

## What? 
Progalenor is a helper page object to help you write cucumber (or old skool protrator jasmine) tests for pages with responsive behaviour.

## Why?
For responsive testing you can of course use galen. Although I really like this library I found it hard to fit in my build environment.
Next to that, I didn't want to bore the devvers with yet another assertion library / syntax.

## Usage
